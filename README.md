## General Information
An application that I am following through a Udemy course. The application, as its name mentions, is an electronic store in which there is a user section and a supplier section. The user can choose various products presented in a recyclerView. Once your list is finalized, you can proceed to payment through two methods: PayPal and Mercado Libre payment. As the e-shop is a food store, a delivery person delivers the order. The user can observe, through Google Maps, the real-time location of the delivery person. In addition, the business administrator will be able to see the sales and orders that his restaurant has been having.

## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_
<br />
<br />
As I mentioned before, it is a project that right now I am replicating from a course in order to have experience and be able to do more complex personal projects. So far, I have only developed 20%, which is the registration and authentication of users through the mobile application via the API Rest in Node.js. There are still many things to add, but with time I will implement them.
